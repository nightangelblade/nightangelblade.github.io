<p>Ever since I first played the first Assassin's Creed on the Playstation 3, the series has become one of the near yearly titles that I always aim to pick up. The idea and story behind it is one that I keep on wanting to come back to and learn more about.</p>

<p><b>Background:</b> Assassin's Creed follows a secret organization, known as the Assassins, through different significant periods of time across the world, starting with the original group during the Crusades, whom were based off of the original Hashashin sect. Their enemy in this series is the Templars, based off of the original Knights Templar. Both groups are racing to gain possession of what are known as the Pieces of Eden, powerful artifacts from an ancient race known as the First Civilization, a highly advanced society who appeared to be like gods to mankind. This battle has continued all the way to modern day, where both Templars and Assassins make use of a machine, the Animus, to relive and control various individuals throughout history who were rumors to have seen or possessed the Pieces of Eden.</p>

<p>Here's some of the reasons I enjoy the series:</p>

<ul>
	<li>I enjoy the idea of secret societies and groups who actually are running and controlling what we see or interact with. It gives more depth to a setting thatn what is see on the surface.</li>
	<li>It allows you to freely explore historical interpretations of difference places around the world.</li>
</ul>

<p>Analysis of <a href="http://www.assassins-creedfan.com/">Assassn's creed Fan Site</a></p>
<p>I like the organization and categorization of the navigation in this site, as it keeps things specific enough for users to easily find what they are looking for, and appears to also prioritize them from left to right. The other cool aspect is the feed in the right column of the recent entires on the respective pages. However, the only thing that I found to draw a bit away from the appearance was the top banner, which for doesn't really match the look and feel of the body content. I would have personally put a single banner across the top, rather than separating it into the site logo and a small image to the right.</p>
<p>Upon examining the code of the site, I did recognize a lot of the different tags such as the div and h3 tags, however there was a lot for what appears to be built-in JavaScript functions that are executed through the script tag.</p>
